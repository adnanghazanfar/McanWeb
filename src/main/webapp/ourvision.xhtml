							<h4>OUR VISION</h4>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">We envision a future where
								medical career guidance is available to medical students,
								graduates and physicians all around the world. We aim to provide
								a venue for physicians to share their experience with others in
								desperate need for guidance. We also aim to provide a platform
								for physicians to generate funds for non-profit medical
								education organizations by donating their spare time in medical
								career advising.</p>
