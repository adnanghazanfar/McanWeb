							<h4>HOW IT WORKS</h4>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Medical students , graduates
								and practicing physicians from all over the world will create
								accounts on MCAN, which will have a brief biography about them
								including their skill set that they can give advice on. These
								skills can include anything you think can help another medical
								student or graduate including but not limited to:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Improving your performance in medical school (basic
									science years)</li>
								<li>Improving your performance in medical school (clinical
									years)</li>
								<li>Applying for Research Electives abroad</li>
								<li>Applying for Clinical Electives abroad</li>
								<li>Advice about a specific specialty</li>
								<li>Licensing exams (USMLE PLAB, and others)</li>
								<li>Medical board exams (American board, Royal college
									exams, and others)</li>
								<li>English exams (TOEFL and ILETS)</li>
								<li>Applying for postgraduate clinical training (Residency
									and fellowship)</li>
								<li>Applying for postgraduate Degrees (Master's Degree and
									PhD)</li>
								<li>Experience about living abroad during electives ,
									observerships or postgraduate training</li>
							</ul>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Members will be able to
								search our vast online database for someone that has experience
								in an area that interests them. Members can then send career
								advice questions and even possibly arrange a career advising
								session with other more experienced members. The members will
								decide if they will do this career advising for free or will ask
								for a symbolic fee that will go as a donation for EAMTAR.</p>
